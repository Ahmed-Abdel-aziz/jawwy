1- I use the page object module design pattern.
2- The project has two packages: main and test.
- The main page has a basepage that allows pieces to interact with one another.
- The test contains the basetest and test cases for the "egypt - uae" subscription package, pricing and currency.
 
3- Run all tests one by one in testng.xml.
